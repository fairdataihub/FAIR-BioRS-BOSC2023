# Repository of the FAIR-BioRS guidelines material for the BOSC 2023 conference (July 24-25 2023)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our poster presentation and talk at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2023. We are presenting the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines, the first actionable guidelines for making biomedical research software FAIR as per the FAIR Principles for Research Software (or FAIR4RS principles). 

Making research software reusable is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of research outcomes, prevent duplicate effort, and utimately increase the pace of discoveries and innovations. [FAIR principles tailored for research software](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068) established by the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group provide a foundation for optimizing the reuse of research software. The FAIR4RS principles are, however, aspirational and do not provide practical instructions to the researchers. To fill this gap, established the first actionable step-by-step guidelines to make their research software compliant with each of the FAIR4RS principles. We designate them as the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines. Our process for developing these guidelines are presented at BOSC 2023. Related resources are listed below. Details about the conference are available on the [conference webpage](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2023/).
